# Food Donation System

- About 20% of the food prepared in restaurants is thrown away every day. It is very common to watch excess food from these restaurants, marriages, and other such events go to garbage without thought. 
- Needless to say, this food that goes to trash could serve to fill the hunger of the unfed and starved children, the poor and homeless, when collected and distributed efficiently.
- This application aims to provide this very service, where excess food from restaurants will be collected and catered to those in need, to organizations that feed them,free of cost.
- Consequently, this could help kids who might otherwise become malnourished, people who might die due to starvation. With the co-operation and contribution from many restaurants, a lot of needy people can be fed with at least two meals a day. 
- Through this application, restaurants, cafes, and other food joints can register to help the cause and non-profit organizations for those in need can request for food. 
- The food will be collected from the restaurants by the organizations based on the location given by the restaurant.
